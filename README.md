# Welcome to my portfolio

This is the collected result of my relearning of React and subsequent reimplementation of my personal portfolio. This is the portfolio I always knew I was capable of but hadn't yet taken the time to flesh out. Things like state management, props and hooks used to be rather daunting to me, and my first approach to writing a portfolio reflects that. I didn't yet understand how to make use of the core tools that make React such as powerful and dynamic web development platform. I will always keep that old portfolio here on my GitHub as a reminder of how far I've come thus far. 

To anyone viewing this project, please feel free to clone and use as you need, or use any of the content modularly. I feel I've only begun to scratch the surface of what it means to make a clean, properly efficient web application, and am working everyday to expand my skills and knowledge.

Never stop learning, never quit no matter hard it gets, and give yourself the space and time to become a truly great developer! It doesn't happen overnight, it takes many many hours of spinning your wheels, being frustrated and starting over when your design got ahead of your head. 

I appreciate your visit here, I hope you find something valuable within this code, and  don't be a stranger! I am totally open to pull requests and collaboration.
