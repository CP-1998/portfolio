# Welcome to my portfolio

This is the collected result of my relearning of React and subsequent reimplementation of my personal portfolio. This is the portfolio I always knew I was capable of but hadn't yet taken the time to flesh out. Things like state management, props and hooks used to be rather daunting to me, and my first approach to writing a portfolio reflects that. I didn't yet understand how to make use of the core tools that make React such as powerful and dynamic web development platform. I will always keep that old portfolio here on my GitHub as a reminder of how far I've come thus far. 

To anyone viewing this project, please feel free to clone and use as you need, or use any of the content modularly. I feel I've only begun to scratch the surface of what it means to make a clean, properly efficient web application, and am working everyday to expand my skills and knowledge.

Never stop learning, never quit no matter hard it gets, and give yourself the space and time to become a truly great developer! It doesn't happen overnight, it takes many many hours of spinning your wheels, being frustrated and starting over when your design got ahead of your head. 

I appreciate your visit here, I hope you find something valuable within this code, and  don't be a stranger! I am totally open to pull requests and collaboration.











# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
